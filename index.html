	Queen is a band that formed together in the early seventies by <strong>Roger Taylor</strong> (Drummer) and <strong>Brian <br>
<br>
May</strong> (Lead Guitarist). The band soon recruited <strong>Freddie Mercury</strong> (Lead Singer) and <strong>John Deacon</strong><br>
<br>
(Bass Guitarist). They were very successful after their album “A Night at the Opera”.

<h2>The Band</h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Queen fully started in 1971 after recruiting Bass player John Deacon. They played for a while without any large success, until they met their producer. David Richards saw the band's chances of success and helped them produce bigger music.
 After Queen II came out, people started listening to the band's music. The next year they came out with the very famous "A Night at the Opera" album. This album has the very popular song "bohemian rhapsody", which is one of the most successful songs in the world.
 Queen became a household name after this album, and they still went up from there. The band went years and years with only being succesful. In 1985, Queen played at the live aid concert with various other bands. Their proformence stood out from all the rest, and is forever known as one of the greatest live performances ever.
 This was their last live performance before Freddie's life started to turn, and that effected the whole band in a strong way.

<h2>Freddie’s Life</h2>

<p>
Freddie Mercury was one of the greatest showman in the business, but unfortunately he was acting for his fans
<br>
 too. Sometime in the late 1980's, Freddie got the misunderstood HIV virus. He was ashamed of this, and hid it
<br>
 from the world. 
 His degrading personality was soon seen by his fans, so they started suspecting that he had
<br>
 Aids. Throughout all of this, Freddie and the band continued to make very good music.
  He was also Gay,
<br>
  which was seen as bad at the time. However, the band and their fans were very excepting of this. Towards the
<br>
  end of his life, the band released their final song "The Show Must Go On". This was a very powerful song
<br>
  because it was about his life winding down, and what must happen when he is gone.
   Freddie died on
<br>
   November 24, 1991 from pneumonia.
